Correctly evaluating defenses against adversarial examples has proven
to be extremely difficult.
%
Despite the significant amount of recent work attempting
to design defenses that withstand adaptive attacks, few have
succeeded; most papers that propose
defenses are quickly shown to be incorrect.

We believe a large contributing factor is the difficulty of performing
security evaluations.
%
In this paper, we discuss the methodological foundations,
review commonly accepted best
practices, and suggest new methods for evaluating defenses to
adversarial examples.
%
We hope that both researchers developing defenses
as well as readers and reviewers who wish to understand the
completeness of an evaluation
consider our advice in order to avoid common pitfalls.
